        <p class="card-text">
          After graduating in 2009 with a Bachelor’s Degree (First Class
          Honours) in Multimedia Programming and Design, I spent the last nine
          years working both as a freelance web developer and designer and as
          part of a team in various companies across Galway, Dublin, Berlin and
          Melbourne. I acquired project and time management skills, as well as
          the ability to communicate with team members and clients while
          effectively meeting milestones and deadlines. As a freelance web
          developer and designer I collaborated with several graphic designers
          in Berlin and Melbourne, at the same time maintaining clients in
          Germany, Ireland, Australia and the UK. I have worked on a multitude
          of web and print based projects for a range of clients providing Web
          Design (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign) and Development (PHP, HTML,
          CSS, LESS, JS, jQuery, WordPress, WooCommerce, Bootstrap, Responsive
          Layouts), eCommerce Solutions, Corporate Branding and Graphic Design.
          During my Multimedia degree I studied Information Architecture, and
          therefore have a keen understanding of wireframes, sitemaps and user
          experience design which I put to good use on every project I work on.
          I am currently working in Ireland between Dublin and Galway. I am
          always available to discuss your project over the phone or via Skype.
          These days I enjoy spending my free time riding my bike, baking and
          crocheting.
